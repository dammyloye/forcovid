COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

Project Description
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 trends and vaccination progress across different countries. We will use data from Our World in Data to explore the pandemic's impact and identify key insights.

Objectives
1. Load and clean COVID-19 data from Our World in Data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
3. Visualize data using line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps.
4. Compare COVID-19 metrics across countries.
5. Summarize findings and insights.

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries by running pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (covid19_analysis.ipynb) in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code with Jupyter extension).
4. Run the cells in the notebook to load, clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

Insights and Reflections
- The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on countries worldwide, with varying trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Data analysis and visualization can help identify key insights and patterns in the country-specific trends.
- Vaccination progress has been a crucial factor in controlling the pandemic.
